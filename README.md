2. Install the ADB Wi-Fi plugin on Android Studio
3. Connect to the Control Hub or Robot Controller's wifi, and then enter the IP address into the ADB Wi-Fi popup. This will allow you to push your code onto the Control Hub or Robot Controller Phone
4. Then, hit the run button at the top of Android Studio next to the device name. This will push all your code. If everything works, it should say "BUILD SUCCESSFUL".
